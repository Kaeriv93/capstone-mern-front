# Project
Description: I will creating a small web social application. The app will allow a user  to create an account and make posts. They are not only able to make a post to the main page, but also have personal blog posts on their own page. Their personal blogs cannot be viewed unless their page is followed.

# User Stories
As a user I want to be able to register an account and only able to view the page if a user is logged in
As a user when I am logged in it will redirect me to my profile page
As a user when I am signing up, I want to be able to make edits to my page
I want to be able to make a personal blog on my actual profile, but it will not be viewable unless another user is following my page.
I want to be able to set my status as available or away
As a user I want to be able to make a post on the main page section where anyone can view
As a user I want to be able to view my friends/ followers page

# MVP
Authentication, we will be using JWEB Tokens again, but this time we will set it to locale storage
This will be based with a REACT FrontEnd, will attempt to rework django backend, but if proven difficult will switch to a MERN stack application
Able to have an add friend/follower feature

# Stretch
Implementing a real chat system. In my play around I was able to get it to work only locally, but I will have to configure it so that it will display the user's name and such.
Implement a dark/light theme
Having userâ€™s able to repost another users blog
Using Django REST Framework over MERN
Impressed with an upload file from the computer, I would love to implement that if possible.
